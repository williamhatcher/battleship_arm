# Battleship Game in ARM Assembly 

This is the code for my Computer Organization final project in which we were asked to make a "lame" version of battleship. 

__Original Requirements__
- Written in ARM Assembly 
- 10x10 board
- Single player (the player tries to hit the computer's randomly placed ship)
- One ship 4 units wide
- Ship location randomly generated
- One hit sinks the ship


I went above and beyond for some reason by adding the following before turning in my final submission:
- Printing out the board with colors
- Controlling the game with arrow keys

I will be adding more features and changing the code quite a bit as I go along. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for details. 

Thanks to Mike McHugh for assigning the project, the other students for insight, and Jaffa for suggesting I add color to my board which was the key to this project exploding. 


**Note: Code has not been uploaded yet and will be uploaded on Friday, December 11**
